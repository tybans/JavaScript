How to use the Javascript to manipulate the DOM
Basically focus on naming convention while writing in Javascript
if we use CSS properties in JS then we need to use camelCase.
// for example: background-color in CSS will be backgroundColor in JS
// for example: font-size in CSS will be fontSize in JS
So that's how we can use the CSS properties in JS and manipulate the DOM
